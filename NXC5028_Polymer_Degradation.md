# Introdution
monomer ---**polymerization**---> polymer  
polymer --**depolymerization**--> monomer

Molecular weight decrease quickly at very beginning, and almost no change for mechanical and physical property.
## Factors of Polymer Degradation
### Intrinsic Cause
- Composition and chain structure of polymer
- Molecular weight
- Aggregation state
- Impurity (auxilliary, dye, pigment and etc.)
  
### Extrinsic Cause
- Heat + $O_2$
- Light (sun light)
- Oxygen and Ozone($O_3$) --> oxidation
- Water
- Others
