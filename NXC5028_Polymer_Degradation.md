## Factors of Polymer Degradation
### Intrinsic Cause
- Composition and chain structure of polymer
- Molecular weight
- Aggregation state
- Impurity (auxilliary, dye, pigment and etc.)
  
### Extrinsic Cause
- Heat + $O_2$
- Light (sun light)
- Oxygen and Ozone($O_3$) $\longrightarrow{}$ oxidation
- Water
- Others

### Impurity
The impurity can include:
- Initiator, unreacted monomer, side product.
- **Auxiliary I**(during the reaction): emulsifier, dispersant, stabilizer.
- **Auxiliary II**(during the processing and molding): dye, pigment, plasticizer, filler.
- Others: metal ions.

### Oxidation in Heating
**Heat**: Chain Movement $\rightarrow$ Degradation or crosslink $\rightarrow$ Mechanical Properties 
**Energy**: Break Chemical Bond $\rightarrow$ Radical $\rightarrow$ Degradation $\rightarrow$ Mechanical Properties

In very high temperature, the free radical can produce **peroxylradicals**.

### Degradation by Light
Energy of single photon: $E=hv=hc/\lambda{}$

Energy of $1$ mol photon:  $E=Nhv=Nhc/\lambda=1.197*10^{-5}/\lambda{}(kJ/nm)$

IR can also generate heat, which has a similar result as heat.

### Degradation by Oxidation
Generation of ozone in nature:

$O_3 + hv \rightarrow{} 2O$  
$O + O_2 \rightarrow{} O_3$

and,

$2O_3 \rightarrow{} 3O_2 \qquad \Delta{}H=-286.4\: kJ/mol$

### Degradation by Water
Some of groups will be affected by water like ester bond.

Water molecules can insert between oxygen atoms in polymer chains, and form hydrogen bond, make polymer chains has rubber-like physical properties.

### Note in Examples
- Amide bond is more stable than ester bond.
- With large side group, the oxygen will be more difficult to attack the hydrogen atoms on the chain. (**Steric Hindrance Effect? Shield Effect?**).
- $Đ=M_w/M_n$ show the dispersion of molecular weight.
- The density of amorphous materials is lower than corresponding crystalline state.
- Weather Ability: shows the ability of adaption different temperature.

### Example 1:
The primary reason why $PTFE$ is more stable than $PE$ is, the difference of bond energy of $C-H$ and $C-F$.

### Quiz 1:
**Q:** $PE$ vs. $PVC$, which one is more stable in pratical application.  
**A:** $PE$, $C-Cl$ is easy to break, so $PVC$ will release $HCl$ gas in sunlight and high temperature.

## Polymer Stabilization
To prolong the lifetime of polymer under the premise of suitable degradation.

### Polymer Synthesis: Polymerisation
**Bulk:**
- Simple
- Low cost
- Fast
- High purity
- *Poor PDI.* Because there is 'gel' effect.
- *Branched*

**Emulsion:**
- Fast
- High purity
- Good PDI
- Fine particle size
- *Unsaturated bond*
- *Branched*
- *Impurity*

**Suspension:**
- Lower impurity
- Lower unsaturated bond

### Polymer Process
#### **Pre-treatment**
As mentioned before, there would be side reaction with $H_2O$ at high temperature, so dry before processing is important.

### Polymer Synthesis: Other Parameters
#### **Temperature**
In lower Temperature, the racial is not so active, the reaction has better control than higher temperature:
- Low Disproportionation
- Low Branched
- High $M_n$
- Good $PDI$
- No gel effect

#### **End Group Modification**
Change the active end group to stablize the polymer, for example, $-CH_2O-CH_2OH$ deslove in high temperature, we can remove the active $-CH_2OH$ end group by esterification.

### **Blend**
Unsaturated polymers is easy to oxidation, like nature rubber, blending with EPDM, which is more sensitive to ozone and react with ozone before the polymer. 

# Degradations
## Thermal Degradation Mechanisms
### Depolymerization(Zippering reaction)
Start from the end of the chain of weak bond. And product of the depolymerisation is monomer.

At the early stage, MW does not change fast, but the total weight changes very fast.

**Structure**: Quaternary carbon in the repeat unit. And High monomer yield.

**Example**: PMMA, PAMS, POM, PTFE

### Random Chain-breaking Reaction
The reaction position is random, and produce low MW polymer(or oligomer).

At the early stage, the MW decreases dramatically, but the total weight does not.

**Structure**: The weak point of polymer where degradation happen, and the dissociation energy can be decreased by nearby groups.

The higher crosslink density can improve the thermal stability.

And high crystallinity will increase the thermal stablility.

**Example**: PE, PP, PAN, PMA

### Small Molecule Elimination without Breaking of the Main Chain.
At the beginning of the elimination, the side chain of group eliminated, while the backbone keep, the product is the polymer backbone and small molecules.

At the end of the elimination, normal thermal degradation.

**Example**: PVC, PVAc

## Stabilization of Thermal Decomposition
### Thermal Stabilizaer
React with the active bond in polymer, to give stable bond.

Or, stop the chain reaction of thermal decomposition.

### Optimize the Polymer Structure
Structure with aromatic and hetero cycles and amide bond will be stable, like Kavlar.

Or change the structure to more rigid: **ladder polymer** or **Graphene-like polymer**.

## Thermal-Oxidative Degradation
In a given temperature, degradation action with $O_2$, and more common than pure Thermal Degradation.

In higher [$O_2$], Vox is not dependent on [$O_2$],[$RH$]. If the [$O_2$] is very low, then [$R\cdot{}$] >> [$ROO\cdot{}$], Vos is dependent on the reaction rate of $R\cdot{}$ and $O_2$.

## Factors of Thermal-oxidative degradation
### Degree of Saturation of Polymer
Saturated polymer is more stable than unsaturaed.

### Degree of Branch of Polymer

### Substituent and Crosslink
One $H$ is substituted by $R$, the possiblity of oxidation increase by $3.3^n$, n is number of substituent.

One $H$ in $-CH3$ is substituted by $-Ph$, the possiblity will be $24$ times. If is a Vinyl, will be $108$ times.

### Crystallinity
Crystal is ordered structure. Penetration of $O_2$ is related to the crystallinity.
