# Introdution
monomer ---**polymerization**---> polymer  
polymer --**depolymerization**--> monomer

Molecular weight decrease quickly at very beginning, and almost no change for mechanical and physical property.

## Factors of Polymer Degradation
### Intrinsic Cause
- Composition and chain structure of polymer
- Molecular weight
- Aggregation state
- Impurity (auxilliary, dye, pigment and etc.)
  
### Extrinsic Cause
- Heat + $O_2$
- Light (sun light)
- Oxygen and Ozone($O_3$) $\longrightarrow{}$ oxidation
- Water
- Others

### Impurity
The impurity can include:
- Initiator, unreacted monomer, side product.
- **Auxiliary I**(during the reaction): emulsifier, dispersant, stabilizer.
- **Auxiliary II**(during the processing and molding): dye, pigment, plasticizer, filler.
- Others: metal ions.

### Oxidation in Heating
**Heat**: Chain Movement $\rightarrow$ Degradation or crosslink $\rightarrow$ Mechanical Properties 
**Energy**: Break Chemical Bond $\rightarrow$ Radical $\rightarrow$ Degradation $\rightarrow$ Mechanical Properties

In very high temperature, the free radical can produce **peroxylradicals**.

### Degradation by Light
Energy of single photon: $E=hv=hc/\lambda{}$

Energy of $1$ mol photon:  $E=Nhv=Nhc/\lambda=1.197*10^{-5}/\lambda{}(kJ/nm)$

### Note in Examples
- Amide bond is more stable than ester bond.
- With large side group, the oxygen will be more difficult to attack the hydrogen atoms on the chain. (**Steric Hindrance Effect? Shield Effect?**).
- $ƒê=M_w/M_n$ show the dispersion of molecular weight.
- The density of amorphous materials is lower than corresponding crystalline state.
- Weather Ability: shows the ability of adaption different temperature.

### Example 1:
The primary reason why $PTFE$ is more stable than $PE$ is, the difference of bond energy of $C-H$ and $C-F$.

### Quiz 1:
**Q:** $PE$ vs. $PVC$, which one is more stable in pratical application.  
**A:** $PE$, $C-Cl$ is easy to break, so $PVC$ will release $HCl$ gas in sunlight and high temperature.
