## Assessment

- Examination: $50\%$
- Course Work/Labs: $30%$
- In-Class Task: $20%$

## Class Traffic Light System

Every slide will be marked with a coloured circle indicating its importance:
- $\color{green}{Green.}$ Key principles of the modlude, must be fully understood.
- $\color{yellow}{Yellow.}$ Important context, additional understanding to key principles.
- $\color{red}{Red.}$ Information provided for interest, not required for exam. This part will appear less frequently in the note.

## $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definitions

**Surface** and **Interface** refers to a boundary between two phases.

Interface is the **boundary between two condensed phases**.  
Surface can be limited to its 2D geometrical meaning.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Interface' is used where the two phases are named explicitly, like 'sureface of solid' $\rightarrow$ 'solid/gas interface'.

### Additional Difinition

- **Substrate(also adsorbent).** The solid surface onto which adsorption can occur.
- **Adsorbate** The general term for the atomic or molecular species which are adsorbed onto the substrate.
- **Adsorption** The process in which a molecule (Adsorbate)becomes adsorbed onto the surface of another phase. Positive adsorption is the enrichment and negative adsorption is depletion of one or more components in an interfacial layer.**(Also it is used to describle uptake of a solid or liquid phase into bulk)**

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Importance of Surface and Interface

It's very common in daily life, for example: texture, friction, surface-tension, corrosion...

Microscopic properties of surfaces are different from bulk material. For, example, it can provide a starting point for building very small structures. What's more, nanotechnology allows for a high surface/volume ratio.

Structures like surface layer or micelles can be formed without external force $\rightarrow{}$ Self-Organization.

## Surface Sensitivity/Specificity

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Intro to Molecular Adsorption

In case of a surface catalysed reaction, it's possible to simplify the whole process into the following $5$ basic steps:

- **Diffusion of Reactants** to the active surface
- **Adsorption** of one or more reactants onto the surface
- **Surface Reaction**
- **Desorption of Production** from the surface
- **Diffusion of Products** away from the surface

### How do Molecules Aborb to Surface

#### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ **Physisorption(Physical Adsorption)**

Only bonding by weak Van der Waals force, and no significant electron density change in molecular or substrate surface.

#### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ **Chemisorption**

Form a chemical bond between the adsorbate and substrate, and the nature of this bond is between ionic and covalent.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Characteristics of Adsorption Processes**

||Chemisorption|Physisorption|
|:-----:|:----------------|:----------------|
|Material Specificity|Substantial variation between materials|Slight Dependence upon substrate composition|
|Crystallographic Specificity|Clear variation between crystal planes|Virtually independent of surface atomic geometry|
|Temperature Range|Virtually unlimited(but a given molecular is limited)|Near or below the condensation point of gas|
|Adsorption Enthalpy|Wide range, related to bond strength|Related to factors like molecular maand polarity, similar to heat liquefaction|
Nature of Adsorption|Often dissociatibe, may be irreversible|Non-dissociative, reversible|
Saturation Uptake| Limitied to one monolayer|Multilayer uptake possible|
Kinetics of Adsorption|Vary variable, ofen an activated process|Fast, since it is a non-activated process|

### Surface Sensitivity & Surface Specificity

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Definitions**

- **Surface Sensitivity.** The ability of a measurement or analysis techniques to detect surface properties.
- **Surface Specificity.** The volume of interest for analysis(i.e. the required detection volome).

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **General Problems**

In virtually all surface studies, sensitivity(detection limits) is a major problem to all forms of spectroscopy.

All surface sensitive measurements need a clean surface.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Surface Cleaning**

The surface of a material is contaminated $\rightarrow$ Greatly affect any result from surface sensitive analysis techniques.

Surface clean methods:

- **Cleavage of the bulk crystal.** Removing the top layer of a crystal to generate a new surface.
- **Heating** Thermal degradation.
- **Ion bombardment(e.g. sputtering)** Impacting the surface with highly reactive noble gas ions.
- **In situ chemical treatment** 
- **Surface Covering.** Growing a thin film of the desired substrate material on a surface of a contaminated material on a surface of a contaminated material.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Surface Material Detection

To ensure that the bulk signal is smaller than the surface signal, so the vast majority of detected signal comes from the surface region.

## Surface Tension

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ General Principles

Attractive force between molecules of a liquid:

- Inner molecules are in equilibrium $\rightarrow$ pulled in all directions.
- Surface molecules are attracted inwardly, resulting in compression $\rightarrow$ a tension acting tangential to the surface, like 'elastic membrane'.

## Colloids

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Introduction to Colloidal Systems

Colloid is composed of particles ranging in size from $1nm$ to $100 \mu{}m$, for example, gels.

Here shows the relationship between colloidal system and substances.

|Solvent/Solute|Gas|Liquid|Solid|
|---|-----|------|------|
|Gas|None|Liquid Aerosols|Solid Aerosols|
|Liquid|Liquid Foam|Emulsion|Sol|
|Solid|Solid Foam|Gel|Solid Sol|

# General Concepts

## $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Law: Surface vs. Volume

Not hard to find that, for characteristic length $D$, we have:

$$
Surface Area/Volume = {{D^2}\over{D^3}} = 1/D
$$

The activity of a surface(**Surface Energy**) is proportional to Surface Area.

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Law: Optics

The smallest resolvable distance($d$) by a lens is given by *Abbe Sine* condition:

$$
d={{0.61 \lambda{}}\over{n\sin{\alpha{}}}}
$$

Where $\lambda$ is the wave length of the light, and $n \sin{\alpha{}}$ is the numerical aperture of the lens. Therefore shorter wavelengths = smaller feature size.

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Laws: Intro to Quantum Mechanics

Scaling laws apply down to the sub-micrometre scale. However, as we approach the atomic sizes, we use quantum mechanics instead of classical one.

### Max Planck

Plank's hypothesis was that energy only comes in discrete packets(*quanta*).

$$
E=hv={{hc}\over{\lambda{} }}
$$

### Louis de Broglie

Theorised that particals can have the same behavious as waves.

$$
\lambda{}={h\over{mv}}
$$

## Force Between Atoms and Molecules

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ General Points

For small particles, the forces acting can be significant.

Small particles have high surface energy, caused by a high surface area per volume, can also be exploited in nanotechnology.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Bonding in Solids

- **Ionic.** Often to form crystalline solids. Charges must balance.
- **Covalent.** Can Form covalent crystals. And directional orbital overlaps determine molecular shape
- **Metallic.** Form crystalline solids.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Interaction Forces

The weaker forces between molecular are often referred to as Van der Waals forces. They can be divided into three categories:

- **Dipole Interactions.** Two polar molecules. ~5% strength of a covalent bond.
- **Dispersive forces(or London forces).** Two any molecules.
- **Repulsive forces.** Between electron clouds of two atoms, to prevent they from overlapping.

# Chemical Attractive Forces

## Hydrogen Bonding

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definition

The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between two species that arise from the following linkage.

$$
A-H--B
$$

Where $A$ and $B$ are highly electronegative elements, and $B$ should possesses a long pair of electrons.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrogen Bonding in Water

Water forms strong cohesive hydrogen bonds between moleculars.

This molecular cohension is important in the hydrophobic effect and surface tension phenomena.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrogen Bonding in Organic Molecules

Both Intermolecular and Intramolecular hydrogen bonds occur  throughout organic chemistry specifically.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrophobic Effect

Water molecules force hydrophobic groups together to minimise their disruptive effect, called "Hydrophobic bonds".

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ The Strength of Hydrogen Bonds

|Bonds|Energy|
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|ion-ion|$100-350\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|ion-dipole|$50-200\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|dipole-dipole|$5-50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|hydrogen bonding|$4-120\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|$\pi{}-\pi{}$ staking|$0-50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|Van der Waals forces|$<5\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|hydrophobic|$<50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Amphiphilic Molecules

These are molecules that contain hydrophobic(non-polar) and hydrophilic(polar) components, like CTAB, SDS and LABS. It's major component of cell wall structures(in this case, it's phospholipids).

> [!NOTE]
> The phospholipid chemical structure is not required for the exam.

## Mecelles

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Micelle Structure

Amphiphilic molecules can form micelles in both aqueous conditions(micelle) and organic solvents(inverse micelle).

The structure of micelles is determined by the surfactant(type, concentration and CMC) and components present.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no solvent in the centre of the micelle structure.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Critical Micelle Concentration(CMC)

The CMC means the lowest concentration of surfacants which miclelles are spontaneously formed.

When addition of surfacant has no further imparct on surface tension, the CMC has been reached.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Beyond Micelles

Amphiphilic molecules can also adopt other structures, for example, two liquid phases can result in emulsion formation.

Some surfacant can also form bilayers.

## Liposomes

Liposomes consist of an aqueous core separated from the continuous aqueous phasa by one or more spherical, bilayer membranes of surfactant molecules.

Here shows different size of liposomes:

- Small Unilamellar Vesicles SUV. $\phi{}=30-100\:nm$
- Large Unilamellar Vesicles LUV. $\phi{}=100-5000\:nm$
- Giant Unilamellar Vesicles GUV. $\phi{}=5-100\:\mu{}m$

The size of Multilamellar Vesicles(SMV, LMV and GMV) are the same.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Formation of Liposomes

Liposomes are not spontaneously formed, it formed from two phase mixture of bilayers(should be formed or forming) and water.

The transition from bilayer to liposome requires energy to rearrange the surfactant molecules. Therefore high temperature will be helpful to the forming of liposome.

The lamellar has two phases, the transition temperature between them is $T_c$:
- The molten state. $L_\alpha{}$ phase
- "Gel" stata. $L_\beta{}$ phase

Liposome can only formed in "molten" $L_\alpha{}$ phase of the bilayer material.

What's more the efficiency of surfactant packing is also significant.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Liposome Structures

The surfactant molecular shape/interaction largely determines the aggregate geometry. This effect indicated by the **Critical Packing Parameter**:

$$
CPP={{v}\over{a_0 l_c}}
$$

Where $v$ is volume of surfactant chain, $a_0$ area per surfactant head and $l_c$ length of surfactant chain.

|CPP|Structure Formed|
|-----|---------------|
|$<1/3$|Spherical micelles|
|$1/3-1/2$|Cylindrical micelles|
|$1/2-1$|Flexible bilayers|
|$~1$|Planar bilayers|
|$>1$|Inverted micelles|

For stable liposomes, CCP should be $0.5-1$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Preparation of Liposome(LMVs)

1. Dissolving lipid (surfactant) in organic solvent, coating of vessel walls, and solvent evaporating.
2. Add water to hydrate, rising $T$ to higher than $T_c$ and agitate to make LMVs.
3. Detached lipid sheets self-close to make LMVs.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Preparation of Liposome(SUVs)

Starting with LMVs to make SUVs or LUVs.

1. Rising the temperature to higher than $T_c$.
2. Sonicator bath or probe tip(300W, 20 kHz) can be used to apply sonic energy to break up to LMVs into SUVs.
3. Usse syringe to extrude the LMVs through a track etch filter(e.g. 100 nm diameter) to make monodisperse SUVs.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Preperation of Liposome(S/L/GUVs)

1. Prepare a water-in-oil emulsion, stabilised by surfactant.
2. Layer the emulsion onto an aqueous phase.
3. Centrifuge the W/O drops from the oil into the water phase.
4. Remove the oil phase.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Imaging Characterisaion of Liposomes

Freeze, fracture, and coat with thin film of metal or carbon, followed by imaging using electron microscopy.

**Cryo-TEM.** Dip fine metal grid into liposome dispersion to give liquid films with liposomes, freeze very fast (to get amorphous water) and image while frozen.

**Optical/fluorescence/confocal microscopies** to image liposomes larger than 1 μm or so.

**Light scattering** to get average size distribution of liposome dispersion.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Suitability -Liposomes as Drug Carriers

- **Solubilisation.**
- **Protection** the drug from biological components.
- **Prolong drug action.**
- **Directing potential.**
- **Internalisation.**
- **Amplification.**

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Dynamic of Bilayer of Liposome in Biology

**Lateral Diffusion** is fast, microns in seconds.  
**Flip-flop** is slow, hours to days.

All dynamics depend on whether chains are frozen or melted.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Osmosis of Liposome in Biology

Liposome always try to keep the same concentration with the outside.

# Adsorption

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definition

$$
Adsorption \neq{} Absorption
$$

- Adsorption: Particular components of a fluid phase are transferred to, adn held at, the surface of a solid. "At a surface or interface"
- Absorption: A fluid phase is transferred from one medium to another "Through a phase"
- Adsorbent: The solid substrate.
- Adsorbate or Sorbate: The substance being adsorbed.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Physisorption and Chemisorption

**Physisorption**: van der Waals interaction, long range attraction.  
**Chemisorption**: the overlap of atomic orbitals, short range.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Factors Affecting Adsorption

- Solute concentration.
- Temperature.
- Surface area.
- Removal of adsorbed impurities(i.e. Activation).
- Adsorbent-solute interaction and solvent competition.
- pH of solution.

## Adsorption Isotherms

The amount of adsorbate on the sdsorbent as a function of its pressure(if gas) or concentration(if liquid) at constant temperture:  $N_s = f(p/c)$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Langmuir

**Term Definition:**

$[n_s]:mg/g;\: mmol/g \:$  
Amount adsorbed per unit mass of the solid  

$[\Gamma{}]:\mu{} mol/m^2 \:$  
Amount adsorbed per unit surface area of the solid  

$c=mg/dm^3 \:$  
Concentration in solution/suspension  

$K \:$   
Langmuir equilibrium constant for the following reaction: $S^{*} + A \leftrightarrow{} SA$

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Surface Area and Monolayer Capacity

The specific area of a material can be established suing the following equation:

$$
a_s=n_m \cdot{} A \cdot{} N_A
$$

Where,  

- $a_s$: the specific surface area($m^2/g$).
- $n_m$: moles of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent required to form a monolayer($mol/g$).
- $A$: area occupied by one adsorbate molecular($m^2/moleculr$).
- $N_A$: Avogadro's number.

For the BET model, change to $a_BET$.

## Adsorption in Details

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Traube's Rule

The adsorption and surface tension is connected.

In dilute solutions, every $-CH_2-$ group in surfacant, the surface activity will be $3\: times$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Gurvic's Rule

The larger the heat of wetting($\Delta{} H_{wet}$) of a solid by the solvent, the smaller the amount of solute adsorbed.

The solvent can block adsorbates from adsorbing to the surface, or deplace them once they are adsorbed.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Adsorption of Polymer at Solid-Liquid Interface

Due to the many configurations that polymer can assume at the surface, polymer adsorption can be very different with small molecule.

Flexible polymers loss more entropy when adsorption, however, the decrease in $\Delta{} G ^\circ{}$ is greater. So the flexible polymers generally favour adsorption.

> [!NOTE]
> The better the solvent is, the more extended polymer is. 

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ General Trends

- Polymer have a relatively high affinity for surface.
- Adsorption increase with decreasing solvent quality.
- In both good and poor solvent, adsorption increases with MW.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Additional Points

Adsorption energy depends on both the nature of the solvent and the surface, as well as competition between polymer and solvent for binding sites.

Polymer adsorption can be accompanied by a change in conformation compared to that seen in the bulk.

## Electronic Interaction

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ The Electric Double Layer

The double layer model is used to visualize the ionic environment in the vicinity of a charged surface.

Charges can occur due to the ionic group at the surface.

Matter at the boundary of two phases has different properties with the matters in bulk phases separated by the interface.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Helmholtz Double Layer

The surface charge potential is linearly dissipated from the surface to the counterions satisfying the charge.

## Gouy-Chapman Layer Models

The counter ions are not rigidly held in the surface, but tend to diffuse into the liquid until the counter potential set up by their departure restricts this tendency.

The kinetic energy of the counter ions will affect the thickness of the resulting diffuse double layer.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ General Points

The electrostatic potential($\Psi$) and the volume charge density($\rho$) are related by **Poisson Equation**:

$$
{{d^2 \Psi}\over{d x^2}}={-\rho{}/(\epsilon_0 * \epsilon_r)}
$$

The ion distribution in the charge surface region is determined by

- Temperature
- The energy required($w_i$) to bring the ion from an infinite distance away($\Psi = 0$) to the electrostatic potential is $\Psi$.

The distribution is given by **Bolzmann Equation**.

$$
n_i=n_i^0 \exp{(-w_i/k_B T)}
$$

Where,

- $n_i^0$. Number of ions of type $i$ per unit volume of bulk solution.
- $w_i = z_i e \Psi$. Described above.
- $z_i$. Valency of ion species $i$.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ The Gouy-Chapman Double Layer

The model has **assumption**:

1. The surface charge is smeared.
2. Ions are point charges.
3. No specific ion adsorption.
4. Dielectric constant is constant.

The Counter-ions are present as a "diffuse" layer, and the concentration of counter-ions decreased with distance from surface.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Debye-Hückel Approximation

When $k_bT >> (|z_i e \Psi|)$, the exponential can be expanded and only the first two terms are retained.

$$
\frac{\text{d}^2 \Psi^2}{\text{d}x^2}=\frac{z_i^2 e^2 n_i^0}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r k_b T} \Psi
$$

Simplifying $\kappa = (\frac{e^2 \sum{n_i^0 z_i^2}}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r k_b T})^{1/2}$.

We have,

$$
\Psi = \Psi_0 \exp(-\kappa x)
$$

Where,

- $\Psi_0$ is the potential at the plate surface.
- $\kappa$ is the Debye-Hückel parameter

> [!NOTE]
> $1/\kappa$ is the distance $\Psi$ dropped to $1/e$ of its value, it is also called the double layer thickness or Debye length. As the concentration of ions increases, the double layer thickness decreases.

$\kappa$ can also be written as

$$
\kappa^2=(\frac{2000 F^2}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r RT})I
$$

Where,

- $F$. Faraday's constant$=eN_A=96.485\: C\,mol^{-1}$.
- $I=\frac{1}{2}\sum(c_i z_i^2)$. The ionic strength of the electrolyte.

> [!NOTE]
> $\kappa = 3.299 I^{1/2}\: nm^{-1}$ for an aqueous phase at $25^\circ C$.

# Emulsions and Colloids

## General Principles

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Dispersion

When one phase is fragmented into small pieces and dispersed in another continuous phase, so called dispersion.

The dispersion systems are non-equilibrium systems. i.e. they are not stable when considered thermodynamically. The stability of dispersion system is kinetic phenomenon.

Dispersions are not solutions.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Emulsions

Suspension of liquid droplets of a certain size within a second immiscible liquid.

**Classifications**

by dispersed phase.

- **Oil in Water**. Oil droplets.
- **Water in Oil**. Water droplets.

by the size of liquid droplets.

- $1-50 \mu m$. Macroemulsions(kinetically stable).
- $0.02-0.4 \mu m$. Microemulsions (greater level of thermodynamic stability).

The stability if emulsion is greatly impacted by stabilising(emulsifying) agents.

> [!NOTE]
> **metastable**. Stable but not forever.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Formation and Stability

Emulsions can not form spontaneously(without agitation).

**Emulsion characteristic**.

- Radiis $a$
- Droplet volume fraction $\phi$
- Surface tension $\sigma$
- Viscosity $\eta$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Surfactants

- Inhibit coalescence of the emulsion.
- Provide repulsive interaction potension between droplets.
- Generally soluble in both continuous phase and dispersed phase.
- Lowers surface or “interfacial” tension (σ) substantially – but does not approach zero (see solubilizate later in Chapter 7).
- Surface tension (σ) provides a restoring force which opposes the increase of droplet surface area (i.e. high surface tensions resist emulsification).

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Types of Repulsion at Emulsion-Emulsion Interfaces

**Electrostatic Repulsion**. Repulsion between charged interface.

**Steric Repulsion**. Repulsion between interfaces with non-ionic surfacetants.

**Entropic Repulsion**.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ DLVO Theory

DLVO theory discribes the sum of attractive and repulsive potentials and give an indication pf its stability.

**Discribes two key values.**

- $V_m$(Barrier). The energetic barrier that opposes redeposition. Increased as interfacal charge increases, decrease wgeb electrolytes are added
- $V_{minimum}$. Energy required to separate the two interfaces already in contact.

**Secondary Minimum.**

When a system has a high order of van der Waals, this long range attraction cause a secondary energy minimum, which is a stable and reversable emulsion separation distance.

> [!NOTE]
> Different diagrams may usse a different "Zero Point".

## Emulsification Methods

**Comminution (Destruction).**

Use mechanical energy to form the emulsion. Most widely used procedure.

**Condensation (Construction).**

Thermodynamically dirven. Involves the swelling of preformed systems.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Action of Emulsifiers

- Reduces the interfacial tension between the phases.
- Forms a barrier between the phases.
- Promotes the formation of an emulsion (easier to prepare).
- Allows smaller droplet size formation.
- Aids the stability of the dispersed state.
- Controls the type of emulsion formed, i.e. O/W or W/O

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Emulsion Formation by Comminution

**Work**

The increase in the energy of an emulsion compared to the non-emulsified components is equal to $\Delta W$.

$$
\Delta W = \sigma . \Delta A
$$

$\Delta W$ is free energy of the interface and corresponds to the reversible work brought permanently into the system.

**Progression**

When the shear exerted by the turbulent micro-eddies on the droplet interface exceeds the cohesive forces of the liquids in the drops, they split up into smaller units.

**Summary**

The emulsification process is influenced by various parameters:

- The volume phase ratio.
- The viscosity of both phases.
- The mutual solubility of both phases.
- The kind and concentration of additives.
- The stirrer as well as the vessel geometry.
- The diminution energy and the power input.
- Thermodynamic changes during the emulsification process.

## Emulsion Stability

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Measuring Emulsion Size

**Scattering Methods**. Dynamic Light Scatting, Static Small Angle Light, Neutron or X-ray Scattering.

**Microscopy Methods**. Optical microscopy, Cryo-Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ The Structure of the Emulsion

The dispersed phase and the continuous phase is influenced by the volume radio of the liquid and the type of emulsifying agent and its concentration in strong connection with the temperature.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bancroft Rule**.  
> The most important property of the emulsifying agent is its solubility(in both phases). In O/W emulsions, the emulsifying agents are more soluble in water than in oil (High HLB surfactant).

**Testing Methods**.

- **Dilution test**. emulsion can be diluted only with the external phase.
- **Dye test**. water or oil soluble dyes.
- **CoCl2/filter paper test**. filter paper impregnated with CoCl2 and dried. The blue colour changes to pink when o/w emulsion is added – water continuous phase hydrates CoCl2 tuning it pink.
- **Fluorescence**. some oils fluoresce under UV light.
- **Conductivity**. for ionic o/w emulsion (o/w emulsions conduct electrical current).

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance(HLB)

|CPP|$1/3$|$1/2$|$1$|$2$|$3$|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|HLB|$40$|$20$|$10$|$2$|$1$|

At $CPP=1/HLB=10$, the surfactant has equal affinity for oil and water.

|HLB|Applications|
|---|-------|
|$1-3$|Antifoaming agents; inverse micelles|
|$3-8$|W/O emulsifiers|
|$7-9$|Wetting agents|
|$10-16$|O/W emulsifiers|
|$13-16$|Detergents|
|$15-18$|Solubilisers|

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Rate of Coalescence

The rate of droplet recombination depends on the following:

**Physical nature of the interfacial surfactant film.**

Mixed surfactant systems can provide greater stability, when compared to a single surfactant system.

**Electrical or steric barrier.**

No correlations between droplet charge/emulsion stability in W/O emulsions.

**Viscosity of the continuous phase.**

High viscosity reduces the diffusion coefficient:

$$
\text{Stokes-Einstein's Equation: }D=\frac{KT}{6\pi \eta a} 
$$

This results in reduced frequency of collision and therefore lower coalescence. In addition, $\eta$ increases as the number of droplets increases. As a result, many emulsions are more stable in concentrated form than when diluted.

**Size distribution of droplet.**

Emulsions with fairly uniform size distribution are more stable.

**Phase volume ratio.**

The volume of dispersed phase increased, the stability decreased.

**Temperature.**

Temperature increased, usually emulsion stability decreased.

Temperature affects; Interfacial tension, $D$, solubility of surfactant, Brownian motion, viscosity of liquids, phases of interfacial film.
