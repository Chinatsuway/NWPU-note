- $\color{green}{Green.}$ Key principles of the modlude, must be fully understood.
- $\color{yellow}{Yellow.}$ Important context, additional understanding to key principles.

## $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definitions
**Surface** and **Interface** refers to a boundary between two phases.

Interface is the **boundary between two condensed phases**.  
Surface can be limited to its 2D geometrical meaning.

**Note** 'Interface' is used where the two phases are named explicitly, like 'sureface of solid' $\rightarrow$ 'solid/gas interface'.

### Additional Difinition
- **Substrate(also adsorbent).** The solid surface onto which adsorption can occur.
- **Adsorbate** The general term for the atomic or molecular species which are adsorbed onto the substrate.
- **Adsorption** The process in which a molecule (Adsorbate)becomes adsorbed onto the surface of another phase. Positive adsorption is the enrichment and negative adsorption is depletion of one or more components in an interfacial layer.**(Also it is used to describle uptake of a solid or liquid phase into bulk)**

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Importance of Surface and Interface
It's very common in daily life, for example: texture, friction, surface-tension, corrosion...

Microscopic properties of surfaces are different from bulk material. For, example, it can provide a starting point for building very small structures. What's more, nanotechnology allows for a high surface/volume ratio.

Structures like surface layer or micelles can be formed without external force $\rightarrow{}$ Self-Organization.

## Surface Sensitivity/Specificity
### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Intro to Molecular Adsorption
In case of a surface catalysed reaction, it's possible to simplify the whole process into the following $5$ basic steps:
- **Diffusion of Reactants** to the active surface
- **Adsorption** of one or more reactants onto the surface
- **Surface Reaction**
- **Desorption of Production** from the surface
- **Diffusion of Products** away from the surface

### How do Molecules Aborb to Surface
#### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ **Physisorption(Physical Adsorption)**
Only bonding by weak Van der Waals force, and no significant electron density change in molecular or substrate surface.

#### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ **Chemisorption**
Form a chemical bond between the adsorbate and substrate, and the nature of this bond is between ionic and covalent.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Characteristics of Adsorption Processes**
||Chemisorption|Physisorption|
|:-----:|:----------------|:----------------|
|Material Specificity|Substantial variation between materials|Slight Dependence upon substrate composition|
|Crystallographic Specificity|Clear variation between crystal planes|Virtually independent of surface atomic geometry|
|Temperature Range|Virtually unlimited(but a given molecular is limited)|Near or below the condensation point of gas|
|Adsorption Enthalpy|Wide range, related to bond strength|Related to factors like molecular maand polarity, similar to heat liquefaction|
Nature of Adsorption|Often dissociatibe, may be irreversible|Non-dissociative, reversible|
Saturation Uptake| Limitied to one monolayer|Multilayer uptake possible|
Kinetics of Adsorption|Vary variable, ofen an activated process|Fast, since it is a non-activated process|

### Surface Sensitivity & Surface Specificity
#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Definitions**
- **Surface Sensitivity.** The ability of a measurement or analysis techniques to detect surface properties.
- **Surface Specificity.** The volume of interest for analysis(i.e. the required detection volome).

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **General Problems**
In virtually all surface studies, sensitivity(detection limits) is a major problem to all forms of spectroscopy.

All surface sensitive measurements need a clean surface.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ **Surface Cleaning**
The surface of a material is contaminated $\rightarrow$ Greatly affect any result from surface sensitive analysis techniques.

Surface clean methods:
- **Cleavage of the bulk crystal.** Removing the top layer of a crystal to generate a new surface.
- **Heating** Thermal degradation.
- **Ion bombardment(e.g. sputtering)** Impacting the surface with highly reactive noble gas ions.
- **In situ chemical treatment** 
- **Surface Covering.** Growing a thin film of the desired substrate material on a surface of a contaminated material on a surface of a contaminated material.

#### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Surface Material Detection
To ensure that the bulk signal is smaller than the surface signal, so the vast majority of detected signal comes from the surface region.

## Surface Tension
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ General Principles
Attractive force between molecules of a liquid:
- Inner molecules are in equilibrium $\rightarrow$ pulled in all directions.
- Surface molecules are attracted inwardly, resulting in compression $\rightarrow$ a tension acting tangential to the surface, like 'elastic membrane'.

## Colloids
### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Introduction to Colloidal Systems
Colloid is composed of particles ranging in size from $1nm$ to $100 \mu{}m$, for example, gels.

Here shows the relationship between colloidal system and substances.
|Solvent/Solute|Gas|Liquid|Solid|
|Gas|None|Liquid Aerosols|Solid Aerosols|
|Liquid|Liquid Foam|Emulsion|Sol|
|Solid|Solid Foam|Gel|Solid Sol|

# General Concepts
## $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Law: Surface vs. Volume
Not hard to find that, for characteristic length $D$, we have:  
$Surface Area/Volume = {{D^2}\over{D^3}} = 1/D$

The activity of a surface(**Surface Energy**) is proportional to Surface Area.

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Law: Optics
The smallest resolvable distance($d$) by a lens is given by *Abbe Sine* condition:

$d={{0.61 \lambda{}}\over{n\sin{\alpha{}}}}$

Where $\lambda$ is the wave length of the light, and $n \sin{\alpha{}}$ is the numerical aperture of the lens. Therefore shorter wavelengths = smaller feature size.

## $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Scaling Laws: Intro to Quantum Mechanics
Scaling laws apply down to the sub-micrometre scale. However, as we approach the atomic sizes, we use quantum mechanics instead of classical one.

### Max Planck
Plank's hypothesis was that energy only comes in discrete packets(*quanta*).

$E=hv={{hc}\over{\lambda{} }}$

### Louis de Broglie
Theorised that particals can have the same behavious as waves.

$\lambda{}={h\over{mv}}$

## Force Between Atoms and Molecules
### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ General Points
For small particles, the forces acting can be significant.

Small particles have high surface energy, caused by a high surface area per volume, can also be exploited in nanotechnology.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Bonding in Solids
- **Ionic.** Often to form crystalline solids. Charges must balance.
- **Covalent.** Can Form covalent crystals. And directional orbital overlaps determine molecular shape
- **Metallic.** Form crystalline solids.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Interaction Forces
The weaker forces between molecular are often referred to as Van der Waals forces. They can be divided into three categories:
- **Dipole Interactions.** Two polar molecules. ~5% strength of a covalent bond.
- **Dispersive forces(or London forces).** Two any molecules.
- **Repulsive forces.** Between electron clouds of two atoms, to prevent they from overlapping.

# Chemical Attractive Forces
## Hydrogen Bonding
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definition
The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between two species that arise from the following linkage.

$A-H--B$

Where $A$ and $B$ are highly electronegative elements, and $B$ should possesses a long pair of electrons.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrogen Bonding in Water
Water forms strong cohesive hydrogen bonds between moleculars.

This molecular cohension is important in the hydrophobic effect and surface tension phenomena.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrogen Bonding in Organic Molecules
Both Intermolecular and Intramolecular hydrogen bonds occur  throughout organic chemistry specifically.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Hydrophobic Effect
Water molecules force hydrophobic groups together to minimise their disruptive effect, called "Hydrophobic bonds".

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ The Strength of Hydrogen Bonds
|Bonds|Energy|
|:-------:|:-----------:|
|ion-ion|$100-350\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|ion-dipole|$50-200\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|dipole-dipole|$5-50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|hydrogen bonding|$4-120\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|$\pi{}-\pi{}$ staking|$0-50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|Van der Waals forces|$<5\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|
|hydrophobic|$<50\:kJ\:mol^{-1}$|

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Amphiphilic Molecules
These are molecules that contain hydrophobic(non-polar) and hydrophilic(polar) components, like CTAB, SDS and LABS. It's major component of cell wall structures(in this case, it's phospholipids).

**Note**: The phospholipid chemical structure is not required for the exam.

## Mecelles
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Micelle Structure
Amphiphilic molecules can form micelles in both aqueous conditions(micelle) and organic solvents(inverse micelle).

The structure of micelles is determined by the surfactant(type, concentration and CMC) and components present.

**Note**: There is no solvent in the centre of the micelle structure.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Critical Micelle Concentration(CMC)
The CMC means the lowest concentration of surfacants which miclelles are spontaneously formed.

When addition of surfacant has no further imparct on surface tension, the CMC has been reached.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Beyond Micelles
Amphiphilic molecules can also adopt other structures, for example, two liquid phases can result in emulsion formation.

Some surfacant can also form bilayers.

## Liposomes
Liposomes consist of an aqueous core separated from the continuous aqueous phasa by one or more spherical, bilayer membranes of surfactant molecules.

Here shows different size of liposomes:
- Small Unilamellar Vesicles SUV. $\phi{}=30-100\:nm$
- Large Unilamellar Vesicles LUV. $\phi{}=100-5000\:nm$
- Giant Unilamellar Vesicles GUV. $\phi{}=5-100\:\mu{}m$

The size of Multilamellar Vesicles(SMV, LMV and GMV) are the same.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Formation of Liposomes
Liposomes are not spontaneously formed, it formed from two phase mixture of bilayers(should be formed or forming) and water.

The transition from bilayer to liposome requires energy to rearrange the surfactant molecules. Therefore high temperature will be helpful to the forming of liposome.

The lamellar has two phases, the transition temperature between them is $T_c$:
- The molten state. $L_\alpha{}$ phase
- "Gel" stata. $L_\beta{}$ phase

Liposome can only formed in "molten" $L_\alpha{}$ phase of the bilayer material.

What's more the efficiency of surfactant packing is also significant.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Liposome Structures
The surfactant molecular shape/interaction largely determines the aggregate geometry. This effect indicated by the **Critical Packing Parameter**:

$CPP={{v}\over{a_0 l_c}}$

Where $v$ is volume of surfactant chain, $a_0$ area per surfactant head and $l_c$ length of surfactant chain.

|CPP|Structure Formed|
|-----|---------------|
|$<1/3$|Spherical micelles|
|$1/3-1/2$|Cylindrical micelles|
|$1/2-1$|Flexible bilayers|
|$~1$|Planar bilayers|
|$>1$|Inverted micelles|

For stable liposomes, CCP should be $0.5-1$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Preparation of Liposome(LMVs)
1. Dissolving lipid (surfactant) in organic solvent, coating of vessel walls, and solvent evaporating.
2. Add water to hydrate, rising $T$ to higher than $T_c$ and agitate to make LMVs.
3. Detached lipid sheets self-close to make LMVs.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Preparation of Liposome(SUVs)
Starting with LMVs to make SUVs or LUVs.

1. Rising the temperature to higher than $T_c$.
2. Sonicator bath or probe tip(300W, 20 kHz) can be used to apply sonic energy to break up to LMVs into SUVs.
3. Usse syringe to extrude the LMVs through a track etch filter(e.g. 100 nm diameter) to make monodisperse SUVs.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Preperation of Liposome(S/L/GUVs)
1. Prepare a water-in-oil emulsion, stabilised by surfactant.
2. Layer the emulsion onto an aqueous phase.
3. Centrifuge the W/O drops from the oil into the water phase.
4. Remove the oil phase.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Imaging Characterisaion of Liposomes
Freeze, fracture, and coat with thin film of metal or carbon, followed by imaging using electron microscopy.

**Cryo-TEM.** Dip fine metal grid into liposome dispersion to give liquid films with liposomes, freeze very fast (to get amorphous water) and image while frozen.

**Optical/fluorescence/confocal microscopies** to image liposomes larger than 1 μm or so.

**Light scattering** to get average size distribution of liposome dispersion.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Suitability -Liposomes as Drug Carriers
- **Solubilisation.**
- **Protection** the drug from biological components.
- **Prolong drug action.**
- **Directing potential.**
- **Internalisation.**
- **Amplification.**

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Dynamic of Bilayer of Liposome in Biology
**Lateral Diffusion** is fast, microns in seconds.  
**Flip-flop** is slow, hours to days.

All dynamics depend on whether chains are frozen or melted.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Osmosis of Liposome in Biology
Liposome always try to keep the same concentration with the outside.

# Adsorption
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Definition
$Adsorption \neq{} Absorption$
- Adsorption: Particular components of a fluid phase are transferred to, adn held at, the surface of a solid. "At a surface or interface"
- Absorption: A fluid phase is transferred from one medium to another "Through a phase"
- Adsorbent: The solid substrate.
- Adsorbate or Sorbate: The substance being adsorbed.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Physisorption and Chemisorption
**Physisorption**: van der Waals interaction, long range attraction.  
**Chemisorption**: the overlap of atomic orbitals, short range.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Factors Affecting Adsorption
- Solute concentration.
- Temperature.
- Surface area.
- Removal of adsorbed impurities(i.e. Activation).
- Adsorbent-solute interaction and solvent competition.
- pH of solution.

## Adsorption Isotherms
The amount of adsorbate on the sdsorbent as a function of its pressure(if gas) or concentration(if liquid) at constant temperture:  $N_s = f(p/c)$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Langmuir
**Term Definition:**

$[n_s]:mg/g;\: mmol/g \:$  
Amount adsorbed per unit mass of the solid  

$[\Gamma{}]:\mu{} mol/m^2 \:$  
Amount adsorbed per unit surface area of the solid  

$c=mg/dm^3 \:$  
Concentration in solution/suspension  

$K \:$   
Langmuir equilibrium constant for the following reaction: $S^{*} + A \leftrightarrow{} SA$

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Surface Area and Monolayer Capacity
The specific area of a material can be established suing the following equation:

$a_s=n_m \cdot{} A \cdot{} N_A$

Where,  
- $a_s$: the specific surface area($m^2/g$).
- $n_m$: moles of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent required to form a monolayer($mol/g$).
- $A$: area occupied by one adsorbate molecular($m^2/moleculr$).
- $N_A$: Avogadro's number.

For the BET model, change to $a_BET$.

## Adsorption in Details
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Traube's Rule
The adsorption and surface tension is connected.

In dilute solutions, every $-CH_2-$ group in surfacant, the surface activity will be $3\: times$.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Gurvic's Rule
The larger the heat of wetting($\Delta{} H_{wet}$) of a solid by the solvent, the smaller the amount of solute adsorbed.

The solvent can block adsorbates from adsorbing to the surface, or deplace them once they are adsorbed.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Adsorption of Polymer at Solid-Liquid Interface
Due to the many configurations that polymer can assume at the surface, polymer adsorption can be very different with small molecule.

Flexible polymers loss more entropy when adsorption, however, the decrease in $\Delta{} G ^\circ{}$ is greater. So the flexible polymers generally favour adsorption.

**Note**: The better the solvent is, the more extended polymer is. 

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ General Trends
- Polymer have a relatively high affinity for surface.
- Adsorption increase with decreasing solvent quality.
- In both good and poor solvent, adsorption increases with MW.

### $\color{yellow}{\bigodot{}}$ Additional Points
Adsorption energy depends on both the nature of the solvent and the surface, as well as competition between polymer and solvent for binding sites.

Polymer adsorption can be accompanied by a change in conformation compared to that seen in the bulk.

## Electronic Interaction
### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ The Electric Double Layer

The double layer model is used to visualize the ionic environment in the vicinity of a charged surface.

Charges can occur due to the ionic group at the surface.

Matter at the boundary of two phases has different properties with the matters in bulk phases separated by the interface.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Helmholtz Double Layer

The surface charge potential is linearly dissipated from the surface to the counterions satisfying the charge.

### $\color{green}{\bigodot{}}$ Gouy-Chapman Double Layer

The counter ions are not rigidly held in the surface, but tend to diffuse into the liquid until the counter potential set up by their departure restricts this tendency.

The kinetic energy of the counter ions will affect the thickness of the resulting diffuse double layer.

The electrostatic potential($\Psi$) and the volume charge density($\rho$) are related by **Poisson Equation**:

${{d^2 \Psi}\over{d x^2}}={-\rho{}/(\epsilon_0 * \epsilon_r)}$

The model has **assumption**:

1. The surface charge is smeared.
2. Ions are point charges.
3. No specific ion adsorption.
4. Dielectric constant is constant.
