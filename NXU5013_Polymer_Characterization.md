## Spectral Analysis Methods

### Relation between the Energy and the Transition

$200-800\:  nm\: \rightarrow{}\:$ Electronic Transition $\: \rightarrow{}\:$ UV-Vis Light  
$2.5-25\: \mu{}m\: \rightarrow{}\:$Viberation and Rotation of Atoms $\: \rightarrow{}\:$Mid-IR  
$0.1-1\:  mm\: \rightarrow{}\:$Rotation of Atoms$\: \rightarrow{}\:$Far IR  

### Characteristic Prarameters

- Aborbance $A$: $lg({{l_0}\over{l}})=\epsilon{}cl$
- Absorptivity $A\%$: $1-T\%$

### Information Spectral Provide

### Components of Spectrometer

Light Source $\Rightarrow{}$ Monochromator $\Rightarrow{}$ Sample $\Rightarrow{}$ Detector $\Rightarrow{}$ Data Collection

## Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy

### Region

- Near Infrared. $10,000\: cm^{-1}-4,000\: cm^{-1}$
- Middle Infrared. $4,000\: cm^{-1}-400\: cm^{-1}$

### Vibration Modes

- **Stretching Vibration**. the change of bond length
- **Bending Vibration**. the change of bond angle

### Principle

Using Hook's Law

$$
v={1\over{2\pi{}}} \sqrt{k({1\over{m_1}}+{1\over{m_2}})}
$$

Wavenumber and Wavelength are interconvertible:

$$
\sigma{}_{cm^{-1}}={1\over{\lambda{}_{\mu{}m}}}*10^4
$$

Using the Wavenumber:

$$
\sigma{} = {1\over{2\pi{}c}} \sqrt{k({1\over{m_1}}+{1\over{m_2}})}
$$

where,

- $k$. The bond energy, or the constant force between atoms.
- $m_1$ and $m_2$. The atom mass in the vibration.

When the sample is irradiated with IR light, it will selectively absorb the bands that match its vibration, resulting the infrared spectra.

### Penetration Depth $d$

The depth at which the amplitude of the stationanry wave attenuates to $1/e$ of the original.

$$
d={{\lambda{}}\over{2\pi{}n_1 \big[{}sin^2 i - (n_2 l n_1)^2} \big]{}^{1/2}}
$$

### Wavenumber of IR

The boundary of the wavenumber of infrared spectrum is $1300\: cm^{-1}$

**$4000-1300\: cm-^{1}$.** The functional group region.

**$1300-650\: cm^{-1}$.** The fingerprint region, reflect subtle structure information.

## Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

### Spectral Regions

- **Vacuum ultraviolet region.** $<200 \: nm$
- **Ultraviolet region.** $200-400 \: nm$
- **Visible Region.** $400-800 \: nm$

|Transition Type|Absorption Wavelength|
|-----|-----|
|$\sigma{} \rightarrow \sigma{}^*$|~$150$|
|$n \rightarrow \sigma{}^*$|$<200$|
|$\pi \rightarrow \pi ^*$|~$200$|
|$n \rightarrow \pi ^*$|$200$~$400$|

### Characteristic of the Spectrum

Band number, wave length, intensity, shape, maximum and minimum.

Basic concepts are below:

1. Chromophore
2. Auxochrome
3. Red- and blue-shift

### Main Application

- Identify the chromophore structure
- Confirm the identity of a substance
- Conduct color analysis
- Provide the qualitative information for Fluorescence Spectroscopy

# Mass Spectra

Mass spectra: ***relative abundance/ intensity*** vs. ***mass-to-charge-radio***.

Only the cations can be seen on mass spectra.

## General Concepts

### Ionization-Chemical Ionization(CI)

Parent ion = [M+H]$^+$ of pentobarbital = [X+1]$^+$

**Advantages**. Less fragmentation convey molecular weight information.

**Limitations**. Restricted to violatile and thermal-stability.

### Ionization

The order of energy required to remove electron from bonding system is as followed:

sigma bond > conjugated $\pi$ bond > non-conjugated $\pi$ bond > non-bonding lone pair

### Mass Analyzer

There are different types of :

- Single Quadrupole(SQ)
- Triple Quadrupole(QQQ)
- Time of Flight(TOF)
- Ion Trap(IT)

### The Molecular Ion Peak

The stability of which is usually in the order:

Aromatic > conjugated alkenes > alkenes > cyclic compounds > carbonyl compound > linear alkanes > ethers > esters > amines > acids > alcohols

### Isotopes

A variant of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number and atomic mass number.

### Rearrangement

The reaction normally break and/or making carbon-carbon $\sigma$ bonds.

The low energy of the product help stablize the product.

**McLafferty Rearrangement**.
Maily occur in mass spectromatry during the fragmentation. Fragmentation of a carbonyl-containing radical cation via $\beta$-cleavage to produce an enol radical cation and an alkene.

## Interpretation of Mass Spectra
**Base Peak**: the highest peak in the spectra(can be molecular ion peak itself).

**Fragment Ion Peak**. m/z < m/z M$^{+}$ peaks. And odd $e^{-}$ fragment ion peak is important: Any atoms that is not C or H.

For **EIM**. M/z[M$^+$] is typically = amu of M.

For **CIMS**. M/z[M+H]$^+$ is typically = amu of M +1

### Nitrogen(N) Rule

For **EIMS**. An odd m/z means an odd number of N.

For **CIMS**. An odd m/z means an even number of N.

### Fragmentation of Alkane

Fragmentation often splits off simple alkyl groups.

Branched alkanes tend to fragment forming the most stable carboncation.

### Fragmentation of Alcohols

May loss hydroxyl radical or water.

For primary alcohol, usually has prominent peak at m/z 31 corresponding to $H_2C=OH^+$

### Fragmentation of Ester

Forming melecular ions, $R-C=O^+$ and $^+O=C^-$.

### Fragmentation of Aromatics

Fragment at the benzylic carbon, forming  a stabilized benzylic carboncation(rearrange to the tropylium ion).

### Unknown Compounds

The degree of unsaturation: 

$$
\Omega = 1+n_c+\frac{n_N-n_H}{2}
$$

## High-Resonance Mass Spectra

MS tell us the relative molecular mass and the structure with the helps of fragmentation patterns. However, more than one compound can have the same m/z. 

High High-Resonance MS can measure up to $7$ significant figures.

## Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization

Sample is mixed with solution of an energy-absorbent organic called **Matrix**. And deposited onto a plate called **target**.

### Ionization

Contain conjugated $\pi$ system, like benzene ring and attached function group, which is able to absorb energy in the form of UV and blasts the molecule into gas phase.

### Time of Flight Analysis

TOF separate ions by time.

$$
KE=\frac{mv^2}{2}=zV
$$

And the time of ion to travel the length of the flight tube is:

$$
T_f=\frac{L}{v}
$$

$$
T_f=L\sqrt{\frac{m}{z}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2V}}\propto \cdots
$$

### Advantages

- The MALDI-TOF can ionizes large organic molecules
- Less fragment, can measure MW.

# Chromatography

A technique for separation of components in a mixture based on the distribution of component between a mobile phase and a stationary phase.

## Terminology and Gernal Concept

Gas-Liquid Chromatography $\rightarrow$ gas mobile phase and liquid stationary phase.

And Gas Chromatography $\rightarrow$ gas mobile phase.

### Terms and Definitions

|Term|Definition|
|----|-------|
|Eluent|Fluid entering the column|
|Eluate|Fluid exiting the column(collected in flasks)|
|Elution|The process of washing out a compound by using a suitable solvent|
|Analyte|Mixture whose individual components have to be separated and analyzed|

### Types of Column

- Packed.
- Open Tubular (Capillary).

### Chromatogram

A plot of detector response vs. elution time.

- $t_r$. Retention time, the time between the sample's injection and the maximum response for the solute's speak.
- $w$. The analyte baseline peak's width.
- $t_m$. The void time, the time between injection and nonretained solute.

## Classification of Chromatography

$\cdots$

## Interaction

### Distribution Constant($K$)

An equilibrium constant that describes the ratio of the analyte concentrations in the stationary phase and the mobile phase.

$$
K=\frac{C_s}{C_m}
$$

The higher $K$, the slower a compound move through the chromatography system, and the easier the two species can be separated.

### Retention Factor($k^{'}$)

Commonly used to describe the migration rates of analytes in a mixture.

$$
k^{'}_A =\frac{ t_{r,A}-t_m}{t_m}
$$

The higher $k^{'}$ is, the more the analyte favors the stationary phase.

### Slectivity Factor($\alpha$)

Relative measure of the retention of two solutes.

$$
\alpha = \frac{k_B'}{k_A'} = \frac{t_{r,B}-t_m}{t_{r,A}-t_m}
$$

Where A is the smaller retention time. So $\alpha$ always not smaller than $1.00$.

### Band Broadening

The process at which the width of analyte' bond increased as it passes through the column.

> [!NOTE]
> **Column Efficiency**. Quantitative measure of the extent of band broadening in terms of the *Theoretical Plate Model*.

### Asymmetric Peaks

**Peak tailling**. Some sites can retain the solute more strongly

**Peak Fronting**. Overloading the column with sample.

**Asymmetric Factor $T$**.

## van Deemter Equation

The equation considers 3 factors along with the mobile phase linear velocity, $u$.

$$
H=A+\frac{B}{u}+Cu
$$

Where,

- $A$. The contribution of Eddy diffusion phenomenon in the column ($H_P$).
- $B/u$. The contribution of longitudinal diffusion($H_A$).
- $Cu$. The resistance to mass transfer($H_s\: \&\: H_m$).

### Eddy Diffusion Phenomenon, $H_P$

$$
H_P = 2 \lambda d_p
$$

Where,

- $d_p$. The average diameter of the packing material.
- $\lambda$. The consistency of packing.

### Resistance to Mass Transfer, $H_s\: \&\: H_m$

# Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging

NMR is the most powerful tool available for organic structure determination.

## Principle

### Magnetic Moment of nucleus

$$
\mu = \gamma P
$$

And $P$ is numerically expressed as follows:

$$
P = m \frac{h}{2\pi}
$$

Where,

- $\gamma$. Angular momentum
- $h$. Plank constant.
- $m$. The corresponding stationary states or eigenstates of the nucleus.

### Nuclear Spin

A nucleus with an odd atomic number or mass number has a nuclear spin.

The spinning charged nucleus generated a magnetic field.

### $\Delta E$ and Magnet Strength

$$
hv = \Delta E = \gamma \frac{h}{2\pi} B_0
$$

v is the resonance frequency of the nucleus. $\gamma$, Gyromagnetic ratio, constant for each nucleus.

## Requirements of NMR

- A spinning nucleus must produce a magnetic moment.
- The energy of a spinning nucleus can be sepaerated into different levels.
- An radiofrequency field supplies energy for the energy transition of a spinning nucleus
- Nuclei in the excited state return to ground state via relaxation.
