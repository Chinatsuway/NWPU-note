# Spectral Analysis
The study for the interaction between matter and light at differrent frequencies(light spectrum). 
- Absorption Spectroscopy
- Emission Spectroscopy
- Scattered Spectroscopy

### Relation between the Energy and the Transition
$200-800\:  nm\: \rightarrow{}\:$ Electronic Transition $\: \rightarrow{}\:$ UV-Vis Light  
$2.5-25\: \mu{}m\: \rightarrow{}\:$Viberation and Rotation of Atoms $\: \rightarrow{}\:$Mid-IR  
$0.1-1\:  mm\: \rightarrow{}\:$Rotation of Atoms$\: \rightarrow{}\:$Far IR  

### Characteristic Prarameters
- Transmittance $T\%$: $100*l/l_0$
- Aborbance $A$: $lg({{l_0}\over{l}})=\epsilon{}cl$
- Absorptivity $A\%$: $1-T\%$

### Information Spectral Provide
The repeating unit, the peaks(**Elementary Peaks**) is similar to the corrisponding organics.

The interaction among adjacent functional group, its character shows in **Polymeric Peaks** .

### Components of Spectrometer
Light Source $\Rightarrow{}$ Monochromator $\Rightarrow{}$ Sample $\Rightarrow{}$ Detector $\Rightarrow{}$ Data Collection

## Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
### Region
- Near Infrared. $10,000\: cm^{-1}-4,000\: cm^{-1}$
- Middle Infrared. $4,000\: cm^{-1}-400\: cm^{-1}$

### Vibration Modes
- **Stretching Vibration**. the change of bond length
- **Bending Vibration**. the change of bond angle

### Principle
Using Hook's Law

$v={1\over{2\pi{}}} \sqrt{k({1\over{m_1}}+{1\over{m_2}})}$

Wavenumber and Wavelength are interconvertible:

$\sigma{}_{cm^{-1}}={1\over{\lambda{}_{\mu{}m}}}*10^4$

Using the Wavenumber:

$\sigma{} = {1\over{2\pi{}c}} \sqrt{k({1\over{m_1}}+{1\over{m_2}})}$

where,
- $k$. The bond energy, or the constant force between atoms.
- $m_1$ and $m_2$. The atom mass in the vibration.

When the sample is irradiated with IR light, it will selectively absorb the bands that match its vibration, resulting the infrared spectra.

### Penetration Depth $d$
The depth at which the amplitude of the stationanry wave attenuates to $1/e$ of the original.

$d={{\lambda{}}\over{2\pi{}n_1 \big[{}sin^2 i - (n_2 l n_1)^2} \big]{}^{1/2}}$

### Wavenumber of IR
The boundary of the wavenumber of infrared spectrum is $1300\: cm^{-1}$

**$4000-1300\: cm-^{1}$.** The functional group region.

**$1300-650\: cm^{-1}$.** The fingerprint region, reflect subtle structure information.
